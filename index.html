  <p><em>Integrated Twitch Chat</em> is an overlay tool that puts chat from your Twitch channel on-screen in League of Legends so that you don’t have to read another monitor to engage with your Twitch audience when streaming. This allows players to play in full-screen exclusive mode instead of windowed or borderless, while still staying connected with their viewers.</p>

  <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>It displays only chat messages from the streamer’s own Twitch channel.</li>
    <li>It does not interact with, read from, or modify the game client in any way.</li>
    <li>It does not provide gameplay advantages, automation, or additional data beyond what is already publicly available in Twitch chat.</li>
    <li>The font style and colors are fixed and not user-customizable.</li>
    <li>Players can adjust the size, position, and transparency of the chat window to ensure it does not interfere with core gameplay or UI elements.</li>
    <li>The application includes no monetization features and is available entirely free to all users.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The purpose of Integrated Twitch Chat is to enhance the streaming experience and audience engagement without impacting competitive integrity or the normal operation of League of Legends.</p>
